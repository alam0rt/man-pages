.SH NAME
sysexits \- exit codes for programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
.B #include <sysexits.h>
.fi
.SH DESCRIPTION
A few programs exit with the following error codes.
.PP
The successful exit is always indicated by a status of
.BR 0 ,
or
.B EX_OK
(equivalent to
.B EXIT_SUCCESS
from
.IR <stdlib.h> ).
Error numbers begin at
.B EX__BASE
to reduce the possibility of clashing with other exit statuses
that random programs may already return.
The meaning of the code is approximately as follows:
.TP
.BR EX_USAGE " (" 64 )
The command was used incorrectly,
e.g.,
with the wrong number of arguments,
a bad flag,
bad syntax in a parameter,
or whatever.
.TP
.BR EX_DATAERR " (" 65 )
The input data was incorrect in some way.
This should only be used for user's data and not system files.
.TP
.BR EX_NOINPUT " (" 66 )
An input file (not a system file) did not exist or was not readable.
This could also include errors like "No message" to a mailer
(if it cared to catch it).
.TP
.BR EX_NOUSER " (" 67 )
The user specified did not exist.
This might be used for mail addresses or remote logins.
.TP
.BR EX_NOHOST " (" 68 )
The host specified did not exist.
This is used in mail addresses or network requests.
.TP
.BR EX_UNAVAILABLE " (" 69 )
A service is unavailable.
This can occur if a support program or file does not exist.
This can also be used as a catch-all message
when something you wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know why.
.TP
.BR EX_SOFTWARE " (" 70 )
An internal software error has been detected.
This should be limited to non-operating system related errors if possible.
.TP
.BR EX_OSERR " (" 71 )
An operating system error has been detected.
This is intended to be used for such things as
"cannot fork",
"cannot create pipe",
or the like.
It includes things like
.BR getuid (2)
returning a user that does not exist in the
.BR passwd (5)
file.
.TP
.BR EX_OSFILE " (" 72 )
Some system file
(e.g.,
.IR /etc/passwd ,
.IR /etc/utmp ,
etc.)
does not exist,
cannot be opened,
or has some sort of error (e.g., syntax error).
.TP
.BR EX_CANTCREAT " (" 73 )
A (user specified) output file cannot be created.
.TP
.BR EX_IOERR " (" 74 )
An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
.TP
.BR EX_TEMPFAIL " (" 75 )
Temporary failure,
indicating something that is not really an error.
For example that a mailer could not create a connection,
and the request should be reattempted later.
.TP
.BR EX_PROTOCOL " (" 76 )
The remote system returned something that
was "not possible" during a protocol exchange.
.TP
.BR EX_OSFILE " (" 77 )
You did not have sufficient permission to perform the operation.
This is not intended for file system problems,
which should use
.B EX_NOINPUT
or
.BR EX_CANTCREAT ,
but rather for higher level permissions.
.TP
.BR EX_CONFIG " (" 78 )
Something was found in an unconfigured or misconfigured state.
.PP
The numerical values corresponding to the symbolical ones
are given in parenthesis for easy reference.
.SH CONFORMING TO
Not in POSIX.1.
Present on the BSDs.
The
.I <sysexits.h>
file appeared in 4.0BSD for use by the deliverymail utility,
later renamed to
.BR sendmail (8).
.SH BUGS
The choice of an appropriate exit value is often ambiguous.
.SH SEE ALSO

.BR error (3),
