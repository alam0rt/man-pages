Externally generated pages
==========================

A few pages come from external sources. Fixes to the pages should really
go to the upstream source.

tzfile(5), zdump(8), and zic(8) come from the tz project
(https://www.iana.org/time-zones).

bpf-helpers(7) is autogenerated from the kernel sources using scripts.
See man-pages commits 53666f6c3 and 19c7f7839 for details.
