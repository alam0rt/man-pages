       Patches - instructions for contributing patches

Description
       If you know how to fix a problem in a manual page (if not, see
       <CONTRIBUTING.d/bugs>), then send a patch in an email.

       -  Configure git(1) for this project.  See <CONTRIBUTING.d/git>.

       -  Follow the instructions for sending mail to the mailing list
          from <CONTRIBUTING.d/mail>.  See also "Send the patches"
          below.

       The above is the minimum needed so that someone might respond to
       your patch.  If you did that and someone does not respond within
       a few days, then ping the email thread, "replying to all".  Make
       sure to send it to the maintainers in addition to the mailing
       list.

       To make your patch even more useful, please note the following
       points:

       -  Send logically separate patches.  For unrelated pages, or for
          logically-separate issues in the same page, send separate
          emails.

       -  Make patches against the latest version of the manual page.
          Use git(1) for getting the latest version.

   Prepare the patches for email submission
       We recommend using git-format-patch(1) to prepare the patches.
       Please use --range-diff to document the differences between
       revisions of the patch set, even in the first revision.

       To prepare a branch to be sent as a patch set (v1):

           $ git format-patch -o ./patches master..HEAD \
                   --range-diff=master -v1 --cover-letter;

       The range diff will be included in the cover letter (or in a
       single patch, if there is only one):

           $ tail -n7 ./patches/v1-0000-cover-letter.patch;
           Range-diff against v0:
           -:  --------- > 1:  7ec952012 foo.3: tfix
           -:  --------- > 2:  d80376b08 bar.3: ffix
           -:  --------- > 3:  892a12470 foo.3: wfix
           --
           2.43.0

       To send a v2 after some feedback:

           $ git format-patch -o ./patches master..HEAD \
                   --range-diff=old_master..old_HEAD -v2 --cover-letter;

       The values for 'old_master' and 'old_HEAD' can be consulted in
       the previous cover letter.  In this example, it would be
       '--range-diff=7ec952012^..892a12470'.

   Send the patches
       We recommend using git-send-email(1) to send the patches to the
       mailing list.  For instructions on how to configure and use it,
       see <https://git-send-email.io/>.  See also <CONTRIBUTING.d/git>.

   Sign the patches with PGP
       See <CONTRIBUTING.d/mail> for more details on signing your mail
       to the list.  See also <CONTRIBUTING.d/git> for instructions for
       configuring git-send-email(1) to use neomutt(1) as a driver.

   New kernel/libc features
       If you write a new kernel or libc feature, you should document it
       in the same patch set that adds the feature, including any
       patches to the manual pages.  The entire patch set consisting of
       both the feature and its manual page should be sent to all
       recipients for a better review process.  That can be done with
       the following procedure:

       1)  Generate the kernel or libc patch set, with a cover letter,
           and using --thread in git-format-patch(1) (as specified in
           our ./CONTRIBUTING.d/git).  This will generate a Message-ID
           header field in the cover letter.

       2)  Generate the man-pages patch set using
           --in-reply-to="<message-id>", where <message-id> is the value
           of the header field of the cover letter.

       3)  Send first the kernel/libc patch set, and then the man-pages
           one, so that they have a consistent order.
