If you're an end user or a distributor, make sure you do this from a
tarball, and not from the git repository.  The manual pages in the
repository have placeholders for the version and last modified date,
which are filled when creating the tarball.  You can create your own
tarball, for which you need to read the RELEASE file.

Run `make help` to see a list of targets and a brief description.

Normally, you'll want to run `make install`, which will copy these manual
pages to <$(DESTDIR)$(mandir)/man*>, which by default is
</usr/local/share/man/man*>.

To install to a different path, modify the appropriate directory variables.
See <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html>.

You can use multiple threads with this Makefile safely, which will run
considerably faster: `make -j install`.

The Makefile used by this project requires GNU make(1).
