Run `make help` to see a list of targets and a brief description.

Normally, you'll want to run `make install`, which will copy these manual
pages to <$(DESTDIR)$(mandir)/man*>, which by default is
</usr/local/share/man/man*>.

To install to a different path, modify the appropriate directory variables.
See <https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html>.

You can use multiple threads with this Makefile safely, which will run
considerably faster: `make -j install`.

The Makefile used by this project requires GNU make(1).
