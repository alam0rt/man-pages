.TH proc 5 (date) "Linux man-pages (unreleased)"
.SH NAME
proc \- process information, system information, and sysctl pseudo-filesystem
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.B proc
filesystem is a pseudo-filesystem which provides an interface to
kernel data structures.
It is commonly mounted at
.IR /proc .
Typically, it is mounted automatically by the system,
but it can also be mounted manually using a command such as:
.PP
.in +4n
.EX
mount \-t proc proc /proc
.EE
.in
.PP
Most of the files in the
.B proc
filesystem are read-only,
but some files are writable, allowing kernel variables to be changed.
.\"
.SS Mount options
The
.B proc
filesystem supports the following mount options:
.TP
.BR hidepid "=\fIn\fP (since Linux 3.3)"
.\" commit 0499680a42141d86417a8fbaa8c8db806bea1201
This option controls who can access the information in
.IR /proc/ pid
directories.
The argument,
.IR n ,
is one of the following values:
.RS
.TP 4
0
Everybody may access all
.IR /proc/ pid
directories.
This is the traditional behavior,
and the default if this mount option is not specified.
.TP
1
Users may not access files and subdirectories inside any
.IR /proc/ pid
directories but their own (the
.IR /proc/ pid
directories themselves remain visible).
Sensitive files such as
.IR /proc/ pid /cmdline
and
.IR /proc/ pid /status
are now protected against other users.
This makes it impossible to learn whether any user is running a
specific program
(so long as the program doesn't otherwise reveal itself by its behavior).
.\" As an additional bonus, since
.\" .IR /proc/[pid]/cmdline
.\" is inaccessible for other users,
.\" poorly written programs passing sensitive information via
.\" program arguments are now protected against local eavesdroppers.
.TP
2
As for mode 1, but in addition the
.IR /proc/ pid
directories belonging to other users become invisible.
This means that
.IR /proc/ pid
entries can no longer be used to discover the PIDs on the system.
This doesn't hide the fact that a process with a specific PID value exists
(it can be learned by other means, for example, by "kill \-0 $PID"),
but it hides a process's UID and GID,
which could otherwise be learned by employing
.BR stat (2)
on a
.IR /proc/ pid
directory.
This greatly complicates an attacker's task of gathering
information about running processes (e.g., discovering whether
some daemon is running with elevated privileges,
whether another user is running some sensitive program,
whether other users are running any program at all, and so on).
.RE
.TP
.BR gid "=\fIgid\fP (since Linux 3.3)"
.\" commit 0499680a42141d86417a8fbaa8c8db806bea1201
Specifies the ID of a group whose members are authorized to
learn process information otherwise prohibited by
.B hidepid
(i.e., users in this group behave as though
.I /proc
was mounted with
.IR hidepid=0 ).
This group should be used instead of approaches such as putting
nonroot users into the
.BR sudoers (5)
file.
.\"
.SS Overview
Underneath
.IR /proc ,
there are the following general groups of files and subdirectories:
.TP
.IR /proc/ "pid subdirectories"
Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories
exposing information about the process with the corresponding process ID.
.IP
Underneath each of the
.IR /proc/ pid
directories, a
.I task
subdirectory contains subdirectories of the form
.IR task/ tid,
which contain corresponding information about each of the threads
in the process, where
.I tid
is the kernel thread ID of the thread.
.IP
The
.IR /proc/ pid
subdirectories are visible when iterating through
.I /proc
with
.BR getdents (2)
(and thus are visible when one uses
.BR ls (1)
to view the contents of
.IR /proc ).
.TP
.IR /proc/ "tid subdirectories"
Each one of these subdirectories contains files and subdirectories
exposing information about the thread with the corresponding thread ID.
The contents of these directories are the same as the corresponding
.IR /proc/ pid /task/ tid
directories.
.IP
The
.IR /proc/ tid
subdirectories are
.I not
visible when iterating through
.I /proc
with
.BR getdents (2)
(and thus are
.I not
visible when one uses
.BR ls (1)
to view the contents of
.IR /proc ).
.TP
.I /proc/self
When a process accesses this magic symbolic link,
it resolves to the process's own
.IR /proc/ pid
directory.
.TP
.I /proc/thread\-self
When a thread accesses this magic symbolic link,
it resolves to the process's own
.IR /proc/self/task/ tid
directory.
.TP
.I /proc/[a\-z]*
Various other files and subdirectories under
.I /proc
expose system-wide information.
.PP
All of the above are described in more detail below.
.\"

under the
.I /proc
hierarchy.

.\"	Date:   Fri Feb 16 01:28:13 2007 -0800

This is a debugging facility to make timer (ab)use in a Linux
system visible to kernel and user-space developers.
It can be used by kernel and user-space developers to verify that
their code does not make undue use of timers.
The goal is to avoid unnecessary wakeups,
thereby optimizing power consumption.
.IP
If enabled in the kernel
.RB ( CONFIG_TIMER_STATS ),
but not used,
it has almost zero run-time overhead and a relatively small
data-structure overhead.
Even if collection is enabled at run time, overhead is low:
all the locking is per-CPU and lookup is hashed.
.IP
The
.I /proc/timer_stats
file is used both to control sampling facility and to read out the
sampled information.
.IP
The
.I timer_stats
functionality is inactive on bootup.
A sampling period can be started using the following command:
.IP
.in +4n
.EX
# echo 1 > /proc/timer_stats
.EE
.in
.IP
The following command stops a sampling period:
.IP
.in +4n
.EX
# echo 0 > /proc/timer_stats
.EE
.in
.IP
The statistics can be retrieved by:
.IP
.in +4n
.EX
$ cat /proc/timer_stats
.EE
.in
.IP
While sampling is enabled, each readout from
.I /proc/timer_stats
will see
newly updated statistics.
Once sampling is disabled, the sampled information
is kept until a new sample period is started.
This allows multiple readouts.

.IR /proc/timer_stats :

During the Linux 4.11 development cycle,
this file  was removed because of security concerns,
as it exposes information across namespaces.
Furthermore, it is possible to obtain
the same information via in-kernel tracing facilities such as ftrace.

.I /proc/tty
Subdirectory containing the pseudo-files and subdirectories for
tty drivers and line disciplines.

This file contains two numbers (values in seconds): the uptime of the

in the idle process.

.SH NOTES
Many files contain strings (e.g., the environment and command line)
that are in the internal format,
with subfields terminated by null bytes (\[aq]\e0\[aq]).
When inspecting such files, you may find that the results are more readable
if you use a command of the following form to display them:
.PP

.EX
.RB "$" " cat \fIfile\fP | tr \[aq]\e000\[aq] \[aq]\en\[aq]"

This manual page is incomplete, possibly inaccurate, and is the kind
of thing that needs to be updated very often.
